# Android-Kotlin-Coroutines
An example app exploring how coroutines are used in Android with RoomDB, Apollo Graphql, Dagger-Hilt, Glide, JetPack Libraries, Repository pattern and MVVM Architecture

#### The app has the following base packages:
1. **data**: It contains all components to access and manipulate data.
2. **di**: Dependency providing classes using Hilt & Dagger2.
3. **ui**: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel.
4. **utils**: Utility classes.

#### Classes have been designed in such a way that it could be inherited and maximize the code reuse.
